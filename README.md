## Agent Presence

Real conversation should not leave you waiting after a single sentence, nor
should it grind to a halt just because the Agent is looking something up,
calling a tool, or working on a task.

Conversation should keep flowing, and the Agent should always be present.

That is why we built **qwen-audio-agent**—a realtime voice runtime that keeps
Agents talking, working, and present. Whether chatting with you, thinking
through a problem, or working on a task, your Agent remains in the
conversation. It listens, responds, and when the task is complete, naturally
tells you:

"It's ready."

## Conversation Continues, Tasks Too

Conversation doesn't stop for background tasks; when a task completes, the
result naturally returns to the current conversation:

  <tr>
    <th width="50%">Office</th>
    <th width="50%">Smart Cockpit</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

Questions that can be answered directly are answered immediately; when tools
or sustained processing are needed, the task is delegated to the backend Agent.
Throughout, the user always faces the same assistant.

For the full design and module breakdown, see the [architecture document](docs/architecture/deep-dive.md).

## Frontend and Backend Support

The voice frontend handles realtime conversation; the backend Agent executes
tasks. They integrate independently and can be combined as needed.

### Voice Frontends

| Voice frontend | Deployment | Setup | Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Qwen Audio 3.0 Realtime](docs/voice-frontends/qwen-audio-realtime.md) | Cloud | Bailian API Key | Duplex voice, tool calling |
| [GPT-Live / OpenAI Realtime](docs/voice-frontends/gpt-live.md) | Cloud | OpenAI API Key | — |
| [Google Gemini Live](docs/voice-frontends/google-live.md) | Cloud | Google API Key | Live video input |
| [Qwen3.5-Omni Realtime](docs/voice-frontends/qwen-omni-realtime.md) | Cloud | Bailian API Key | Live video input |
| [Qwen3.8 Omni Flash Realtime](docs/voice-frontends/qwen-omni-realtime.md) | Cloud | Bailian API Key + workspace-specific endpoint | Live video input |
| [Doubao Seeduplex 3.0 Realtime](docs/configuration/frontend.md#choose-a-service) | Cloud | Volcengine Speech API Key | — |
| [StepAudio 3 Realtime](docs/voice-frontends/stepfun.md) | Cloud | StepFun API Key | — |
| [ElevenLabs Agent](docs/voice-frontends/elevenlabs.md) | Cloud | ElevenLabs API Key + Agent ID | Hosted STT + LLM + TTS, Arabic support, tool calling |
| [Hugging Face Speech-to-Speech](docs/voice-frontends/speech-to-speech.md) | Local | Start the service and set its URL | Configurable STT / LLM / TTS |
| [MiniCPM-o 4.5](docs/voice-frontends/minicpm-o.md) | Local or cloud | Compatible service URL | Live video input, no tool calling |

To connect another voice service, implement the
[Realtime Provider interface](docs/voice-frontends/custom-provider.md) without
changing the Gateway's core voice-session or backend-task logic.

verification level: five stars indicate a thoroughly tested recommended
integration; four stars indicate active development or not yet fully verified.
For detailed configuration and capability boundaries, see the
[backend Agent documentation](docs/backends/overview.md) and
[configuration guide](docs/configuration.md).

## Installation

Requires Node.js 22.22.2+ or 24.15.0+, npm 10+. One-click install (recommended):

```bash
npm install -g qwen-audio-agent
```

For building from source, installing from GitHub, and obtaining a DashScope
API Key, see the [installation guide](docs/getting-started/install.md).

### Ubuntu (Linux) — recommended setup

On Ubuntu the recommended path is the **CLI + WebUI**: it needs no desktop
build, updates with one command, and runs the full Gateway (voice frontend +
backend Agent orchestration).

```bash
# 1. Install Node.js 24 (skip if you already have Node 22.22.2+)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_24.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# 2. Install qwen-audio-agent from this repository
npm install -g git+https://github.com/malek262/qwen-audio-agent.git

# 3. Create the configuration file and add your credentials
qwenaudio config        # prints the config path (default ~/.config/qwaudio/config.env)
```

Minimal `config.env` for the ElevenLabs voice frontend (see
[the ElevenLabs guide](docs/voice-frontends/elevenlabs.md)):

```dotenv
QWEN_AUDIO_REALTIME_PROVIDER=elevenlabs
ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=agent_...
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-key
ELEVENLABS_AGENT_LANGUAGE=ar
```

Then start the Gateway and open a client:

```bash
qwenaudio            # Gateway — keep this terminal running
qwenaudio webui      # browser client, in a second terminal
qwenaudio tui        # or the terminal client
```

The **desktop app** (AppImage / .deb) is optional on Linux. This fork builds
both on GitHub Actions — run the *Desktop Linux Build* workflow and download
the artifacts, then:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i qwen-audio-agent_*.deb        # or: chmod +x *.AppImage && ./Qwen*.AppImage
```

**Uninstall (CLI path):**

```bash
npm uninstall -g qwen-audio-agent
rm -rf ~/.config/qwaudio          # configuration, memory, tasks, logs
```

**Uninstall (desktop path):**

```bash
sudo apt-get remove -y qwen-audio-agent   # or delete the AppImage file
rm -rf ~/.config/qwaudio "$HOME/.config/Qwen Audio Agent"
```

Backend Agents (OpenCode, Qwen Code, …) are separate npm packages; remove any
you no longer need, e.g. `npm uninstall -g @opencode-ai/cli`.


## Quick Start

1. Create your config and fill in the API Key:

```bash
qwenaudio config
```

```dotenv
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your-key
# Voice frontend model: optional, defaults to Qwen Audio 3.0 Realtime Plus
QWEN_AUDIO_REALTIME_MODEL=qwen-audio-3.0-realtime-plus
# Backend Agent: optional, leave empty or set to none for frontend-only mode
AGENT_PROTOCOL=openclaw
# Backend model: optional; explicit values use standard ACP, empty reuses Agent config
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_MODEL=qwen3.7-max
```

Before starting, create a key from the [Bailian API Key page](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/?tab=model#/api-key).
Eligible new users can review the [new-user free quota](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/new-free-quota)
and check remaining usage on the [model usage page](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/model-usage-statistics).
Quota and billing rules are subject to the current official Bailian documentation.

> The example above uses the default DashScope voice frontend. See
> [Voice Frontends](#voice-frontends) for other cloud and self-hosted options.

With a visual-capable Realtime frontend, WebUI can explicitly stream bounded
camera frames alongside live audio. See [Realtime frontend configuration](docs/configuration/frontend.md).

2. Start the Gateway, then open another terminal to start the TUI (or use `qwenaudio webui` for the browser UI):

```bash
qwenaudio        # Terminal 1: Gateway
qwenaudio tui    # Terminal 2: TUI
```

For full configuration options, local voice frontend setup, and TUI platform
notes, see [quick start](docs/getting-started/quickstart.md),
[voice frontends](docs/configuration/frontend.md), and
[TUI notes](docs/getting-started/tui.md).

## Desktop App

The desktop app provides a persistent floating voice orb with a built-in
Gateway, automatic idle sleep, local voice wake, and customizable appearance.
Download the installer for your platform from the releases page, or build from
source:

```bash
npm run desktop:build:local      # macOS
npm run desktop:build:win        # Windows
npm run desktop:build:linux      # Linux (AppImage + deb, no signing)
```

For visuals, orb behavior, and build instructions, see the
[desktop documentation](docs/desktop/overview.md).

## Examples and Scenario Expansion

The current qwen-audio-agent framework focuses on desktop productivity: users
can keep talking with the Agent in realtime while delegating tool use, file
work, code changes, and long-running tasks to the backend Agent.

This "foreground conversation + background task" design is not limited to
desktop use. It can also expand to more scenarios where the Agent can both
chat naturally and get real work done.

| Scenario | Description | Link | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop | Voice chat, progress follow-up, tools, and background tasks. | [Docs][desktop-docs] | Available |
| Smart cockpit | Vehicle control, navigation, music, weather, and services. | [Example][smart-cockpit-example] | Available |
| X-Omni | Visual conversation, on-demand capture, optional observation and narration. | [Example](https://github.com/QwenAudio/qwen-audio-agent/tree/main/examples/x-omni/README.md) | Available |
| AI Passport | Qwen Voice Bean on a hardware card, with voice conversation and backend tasks. Currently half-duplex only. | [Example][ai-passport-example] | Available |
| Customer Service | Voice customer service for retail and airline scenarios. | [Example](https://github.com/QwenAudio/qwen-audio-agent/tree/main/examples/customer-service/README.md) | Available |
| Embodied intelligence | Voice commands, action execution, inspection, and exception feedback. | TBD | Planned |
| Livestream assistant | Audience interaction, product explanation, coupons, and risk reminders. | TBD | Planned |
